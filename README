Fixes rf sync feature and cleans up code to some degree.


== Changes ==

Fixed the rf sync feature (in logic/rfsimplicti.c) so it works again. In my port over
to the RTC module, I'd forgotten to update this code.

Added functions to set time, date, and alarm time.  This should reduce the codesize a
little, not to mention make it easier to read and work with.


== Status ==

Time- and alarm-related functionalities seem to work. The stopwatch seems to work just fine.

The relatively new option to hide the wireless update menu item behind the battery voltage
has a bug -- whenever I switch to it, the watch freezes (until the watchdog times out).
Updating wirelessly works fine without this option enabled.


== Todo ==

  * Fix bug with wireless update (when hidden behind battery menu item).

  * Verify changes haven't disrupted other time-related code (sidereal clock, eggtimer, etc.)

  * Re-arrange use of Timer A, now that TIMER0_A0 interrupt is unused

  * Update and/or verify IAR project file (probably just need to add "rtc.c" and "rtc.h"
    references somewhere)

  * Add in optional hour or noon/midnight beep functionality via RTCTEV interrupt

== Requirements ==

msp430-gcc4 http://mspgcc4.sourceforge.net/
make
python http://python.org

== Supported Compilers ==

msp430-gcc4
   Working combinations:
   gcc=4.4.3 binutils=2.20.1 libc=20100430

IAR msp430

Patches for more (more efficient) compilers are welcome :-)


== HOWTO ==

Copy gcc/intrinsics.h into [msp430-gcc-path]/msp430/include/intrinsics.h

To configure your image, run:

   make config

which will generate a config.h file that contains the settings for your build.

To compile the image run:

   make


It is HIGHLY suggested to make a clean build before you flash the image with:

   make clean main

== Problems ==

 * Compile / Link problems:
   If you get error messages like this one:

     msp430/bin/ld: build/eZChronos.elf section `.text' will not fit in region `text'
     .../msp430/bin/ld: section .vectors loaded at [000000000000ff80,000000000000ffff] overlaps section .text loaded at [0000000000008000,0000000000013343]
     .../msp430/bin/ld: region `text' overflowed by 13250 bytes
     collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

    or
     
     section .vectors loaded at [0000ff80,0000ffff] overlaps section .data loaded at [0000ff4e,0000ffcb]

   Your image is simply to large and will not fit into the flash. Try to disable some modules with make config and try again
   Or even better, send some patches that reduce code size ;-)

== Difference to the TI Firmware ==

 * More Features that can be configured with make config
 * Day of week
 * Disable 12h support (saves space)
 * Sleep Phase Clock - primary designed for http://github.com/poelzi/uberclock
 * The wireless flashing starts differently:
   Select RFBSL, Press DOWN to unlock, Press # long to start
 * No BlueRobin support. BlueRobin is a closed source binary blob.
   We don't have a compatible object file for that
 * Pressing STAR and UP long sets silent mode (no beep)

== Usefull Tools ==
 * mspdebug - debugger, proxy for gdb, flasher, ...  
     http://mspdebug.sourceforge.net
 * msp430static - static analyzer for sourcecode
     http://msp430static.sourceforge.net/
   run 'make source_index' to index all source files
